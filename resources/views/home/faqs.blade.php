                                Here is how the copier works: You, as an investor, simply select an expert or experts
                                that you want to copy trades from. Once you are signed up, this is the only action
                                needed on your part. Once you’ve taken care of the above, you are all set. There are no
                                codes that you need to run or signals for you to manually input. Our software will
                                handle the trade copying automatically on your behalf. We monitor your experts trading
                                activity and as soon as there is a trade, we calculate all the necessary parameters and
                                execute the trade. The only thing you have to make sure of is that you have enough
                                available base currency that your expert trades with, in your trading account. How much
                                is enough? First, you must meet the exchanges minimum order amount (let’s say about $10
                                per trade to be safe). That means that if your expert executes a 5% order, you must have
                                at least $300 in your account total value (at 100% expert allocation as an example).
                                This also means that you need to have at least 10% or higher in available base currency
                                to avoid missed trades. When the expert exits a position, you too will exit it.
                                Automatically. You can also change allocation at any time.

                                crypto networks! If we become aware that a pool is getting close to 50% share, we will
                                switch away from it and use a backup instead.
